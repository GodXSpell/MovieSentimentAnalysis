# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on a large dataset of movie reviews using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The model classifies reviews as **positive** or **negative** based on their text content.

## Features

- Reads and analyzes a clean CSV dataset (`movie.csv`) of movie reviews.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations:
  - Distribution of sentiment labels
  - Review length histogram
  - Word count histogram
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.
- Machine learning model training using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**.
- Model evaluation with accuracy and classification report.
- Predicts sentiment for new, unseen reviews.

- **Accuracy:** 0.86
- **Precision (Negative):** 0.84
- **Recall (Negative):** 0.89
- **F1-score (Negative):** 0.87
- **Precision (Positive):** 0.88
- **Recall (Positive):** 0.83
- **F1-score (Positive):** 0.86

## Usage

1. Place your `movie.csv` file in the same directory as `moviesentimentanalysis.py`.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python moviesentimentanalysis.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Print the dataset and column info
   - Show EDA plots (label distribution, review length, word count)
   - Train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model
   - Print accuracy and classification report
   - Predict sentiment for sample new reviews

--- Testing with new reviews ---
Review: "The story was incredible and the visuals were stunning." -> Sentiment: Positive
Review: "It was a very dull and slow-paced film." -> Sentiment: Negative
Review: "A decent movie, not great but not bad either." -> Sentiment: Negative
```
